WIP - this doesn't really work yet (but it does something already)

### SA:MP server browser & launcher
This project is to provide an alternative to the malfunctioning official browser/launcher (and my first experience of mixing managed & unmanaged C++, C++/CLI and C#, yey!)

### Building
Run <kbd>build.bat</kbd> (you may want to adjust some paths inside it first)

Opening with VS should work, but I can't make it compile everything together so it won't start the game when running it through VS.

### Credits
The original cpp code to inject samp.dll into gtasa was written by @Whitetigerswt ([samp_launcher](https://github.com/Whitetigerswt/samp_launcher))
